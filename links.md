### University of Cambridge

* [Department of Computer Science and Technology - The Computer Laboratory](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/)
    * Course 2017–18 [Algorithms](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1718/Algorithms/) this course is to provide an introduction to computer algorithms and data structures, with an emphasis on foundational material.
    * Course 2017–18 [Operating Systems](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1718/OpSystems/) this course is to provide a general understanding of the structure and key functions of the operating system. Case studies will be used to illustrate and reinforce fundamental concepts.
    * Course 2017–18 [Numerical Methods](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1718/NumMethods/)
        1. an introduction to (IEEE) floating-point data representation and arithmetic;
        2. illustrations of how naïve implementations of obvious mathematics can go badly wrong;
        3. a study of several standard numerical processes, algorithms and techniques.
    * Course 2017–18 [Concurrent and Distributed Systems](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1718/ConcDisSys/) the first half of the course is to introduce concurrency control concepts and their implications for system design and implementation. The aims of the latter half of the course are to study the fundamental characteristics of distributed systems, including their models and architectures; the implications for software design; some of the techniques that have been used to build them; and the resulting details of good distributed algorithms and applications.
    * Course 2017–18 [Advanced Algorithms](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1718/AdvAlgo/) introduce advanced techniques for the design and analysis of algorithms that arise in a variety of applications. A particular focus will be on parallel algorithms, linear programming and approximation algorithms.
    * Course 2017–18 [Advanced Operating Systems](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1718/L41/) Systems research refers to the study of a broad range of behaviours arising from complex system design, including: low-level operating systems; resource sharing and scheduling; interactions between hardware and software; network-protocol design and implementation; separation of mutually distrusting parties on a common platform; and control of distributed-system behaviours such as concurrency and data replication.
    * Course 2017–18 [High performance networking](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1718/P51/) This module provides an introduction to High Performance Networking, it explores both software and hardware aspects and provides the students an opportunity to experience high performance networking design and usage first hand.
